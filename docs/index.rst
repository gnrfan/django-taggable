django-taggable
===============

`django-taggable <https://tabo.pe/projects/django-taggable/>`_
is a library that implements a efficient tagging implementations for the
`Django Web Framework 1.1+ <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, written by
`Gustavo Pic√≥n <https://tabo.pe>`_ and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

``django-taggable`` is:

- **Flexible**: Uses `tagtools <https://tabo.pe/projects/tagtools/>`_ to
  choose between popular tagging styles
  (`flickr <https://tabo.pe/projects/tagtools/docs/tip/flickr.html>`_,
  `delicious <https://tabo.pe/projects/tagtools/docs/tip/delicious.html>`_,
  `etc <https://tabo.pe/projects/tagtools/docs/tip/comma.html>`_), or
  define your own. You can also easily have several tag fields per object or
  have different tag "namespaces" to be used between one, some, or all your
  taggable objects. Your project, your choice.
- **Fast**: No `GenericForeignKey`_ madness.
- **Easy**: Uses `Django Model Inheritance with abstract classes`_
  to define your own models. The API isn't "magical".
- **Clean**: Testable and well tested code base. Code/branch test coverage
  is 100%.
